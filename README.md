Any experimental code should go here before it makes its way into production in one of the other repositories. Here, you have loose restrictions and are free to push and collaborate on code. To keep things organized, **please work in your own branch**; in other words, the main branch should remain empty apart from this document. When you are done experimenting and are ready to commit the code to production, find the respective channel in Discussions (such as Mobile) and ask for feedback. Once at least 5 people explicitly state that your code is stable and useful, you may then create a PR to move it into the respective repository. While I can't enforce this 5-person rule, note that it is mandatory and there are consequences for not following the rules. Anyone can create a branch at any time to experiment, no approval is needed for that. Good luck!
